#Faisal A. Mahmood


I am a highly inquisitive, analytical and driven individual aspiring to build systems that provide solutions to real-world problems.

My decision to enrol in Makers Academy, a selective and hyper-intensive coding programme, enabled me to learn the ways in which I can use tech to change the way (tech and non-tech) people interact with the world and one another.

I am looking to work with and learn from dedicated, intelligent and goal-oriented teams where I can utilise my people and strategic thinking skills to make meaningful impact through tech and beyond tech.

## Skills

#### Lateral Thinking | Problem Solving

I believe that real-world problems are often complex and multi-dimensional.

These problems excite me, so I developed my lateral thinking skills in order to better understand and solve them. My background in Economics, both at <b>Imperial College London</b>  and at the <b>University of Chicago</b>, equipped me with essential critical thinking skills in a framework that evaluates and tackles issues with an analytical and quantitative approach.

I furthered developed these skills at <b> Makers Academy </b>. I enjoy creating systems through code that require the use of logic. Through coding, I  break problems down into small and manageable parts in a structured manner. It is only through this structure that I am able to ultimately build [projects](#projects) that I am very proud of.


#### Adaptability | Working Under Pressure

I believe that the only way to handle outcomes beyond your control is to have a high degree of adaptability.

Whether it was debugging unexpected errors, or handling delayed ship arrivals, I saw the necessity of being adaptable. While working for an off-shore marine services company, <b> Al Jazeera Shipping </b>, my main responsibilities of chartering barges and tugboats involved making decisions under immense pressure of time, particularly when delays directly affected costs associated with port fees, storage and repairs of physical assets.

I gravitate towards challenging environments that encourage innovation and new ways of thinking. This drove me to join <b> Makers Academy </b>, where I adapted quickly to a new way of learning. 


#### People | Team Work

I believe that the core of any organisation is its  people.


  I have made an active effort in developing my interpersonal and relationship building skills. Through my experience as a consultant at <b> Booz & Co. </b>, I saw the importance of relationships and effective communication within teams in order to create organisational change. <br>
  At <b> Emotion Tracker</b>, a small tech start up, I played an instrumental role in establishing partnerships with academic and medical institutions that redirected the organisation to the resources it needs for a strategic market entry.
